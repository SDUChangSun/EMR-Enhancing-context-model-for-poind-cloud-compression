# EMR-Enhancing-context-model-for-poind-cloud-compression
This is the code of our paper 'Enhancing Context Models for Point Cloud Geometry Compression With Context Feature Residuals and Multi-Loss'. We used context feature residuals and multi-loss to enhancing Octattenion. It can be used for object point clouds and LiDAR point clouds compression.
